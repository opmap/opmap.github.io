The exhibion of OpMAP at [ZKM](http://zkm.de/en), Center for Art and Media came to the end. During the exhibition visitors could observe the space of the opinions on the veggie debate in form of a map - see the teaser. Theycould also fill in the questioner
usign the iPad stand next to the projection and see themselves appearing on the map. Below you can get an impression on how the installation looked like. We hope the in the future OpMap will appear in other venues to illustrate other fascinating data sets.
