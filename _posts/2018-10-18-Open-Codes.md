The exhibition of OpMAP at [ZKM](http://zkm.de/en), Center for Art and Media, came to an end. During the exhibition visitors could observe the space of the opinions on the veggie debate in form of a conceptual map - see the teaser. They could also fill in the questionary 
using the iPad stand next to the projection and observe their position appearing on the map. Below you can get an impression on how the installation looked like. We hope that in the future OpMap will appear in other venues to illustrate other fascinating data sets.   

If you have any question regarding OpMAP, or you would like to apply this interactive visualization method to your survey data, please [contact us](mailto:t.mtsentlintze@uu.nl).
